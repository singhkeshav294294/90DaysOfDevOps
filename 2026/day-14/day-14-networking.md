**OSI layers (L1–L7) vs TCP/IP stack (Link, Internet, Transport, Application)**
---------------------------------------------
OSI has 7 layer which are as follows:
pysical 
data
network
transport
session
presentation
appliction 

and TCP/API compress it into 4 layer that is

appliction 
transport
network
physical 

**Where Important Protocols Sit - IP, TCP/UDP, HTTP/HTTPS, DNS **
---------------------------------------------
IP - network/internet
TCP/UDP - transport
HTTPS/HTTP transport
DNS - appliction 

One real example: “curl https://example.com = App layer over TCP over IP”

here it went from application-DNS to presentation (ssl handshake) -->  transport(tcp) --> 

**Hands-on Checklist (run these; add 1–2 line observations)**
